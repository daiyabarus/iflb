                <li>In idle mode, UEs reselect between carriers based on relative signal strengths, applying hysteresis and offsets.</li>
                <li>The configuration divides the signal strength plane into three regions (blue, green, and grey), determining UE camping behavior.</li>

            <p>The Equal Priority Configuration offers a flexible approach to managing UE distribution across multiple frequency carriers.

However, for more specific traffic steering in co-located cell scenarios, other configurations like the Priority Carrier Configuration may be more suitable. Careful parameter tuning is essential to achieve the desired balance between signal strength-based selection and load-based distribution.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>The Sticky Carrier Configuration offers a balanced approach to managing UE distribution across multiple frequency carriers with similar coverage characteristics. It allows network operators to leverage IFLB for efficient load distribution in connected mode while maintaining this distribution in idle mode, leading to more stable and predictable network behavior. This configuration is particularly effective in scenarios where active pushing of UEs to a specific carrier is not required, but maintaining a balanced load across carriers is desirable. By carefully adjusting parameters such as `threshServingLow`, `threshXLow`, and various IFLB thresholds, operators can optimize network performance and ensure efficient use of available carriers. However, implementing this configuration requires careful consideration of the network's specific characteristics. It's not suitable for all scenarios, particularly those involving primary coverage layers or carriers with significantly different coverage properties. In such cases, other configurations like the Equal Priority or Priority Carrier configurations may be more appropriate. Network operators should assess their specific needs, considering factors such as coverage patterns, capacity requirements, and desired load balancing behavior, to determine if the Sticky Carrier Configuration is the best choice for their network environment.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>The Priority Carrier Configuration offers a powerful approach to managing UE distribution across multiple frequency carriers with different coverage characteristics. It is particularly effective in scenarios where one carrier needs to be prioritized to maximize its utilization, while still maintaining overall network efficiency and coverage. The configuration allows network operators to strike a balance between actively pushing UEs to a preferred carrier in idle mode and allowing IFLB to distribute traffic in connected mode. By carefully adjusting parameters such as `THRESHXHIGH`, `THRESHSERVINGLOW`, and various IFLB thresholds, operators can optimize network performance, maximize the use of all available carriers, and ensure seamless coverage transitions. However, implementing this configuration requires careful planning and ongoing optimization. Network operators must consider the specific characteristics of their network, including coverage patterns, capacity requirements, and user behavior, to determine the optimal settings for their particular scenario.</p>

    ## âœ¨ Key Features

    | Mobility Configuration | Priority settings | Idle behavior | Load control | Ideal use case |
    |------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
    | **Equal Priority** | The two frequencies are given equal priority. | Above a configurable signal strength threshold, UEs remain on the serving frequency. Below the threshold UEs are free to reselect to the other frequency if stronger. | IFLB is configured to work in the zone where UEs remain on the serving frequency. | Ideally suited for use between two "coverage layers" whose cells are not co-sited, as it allows UEs to select the stronger of the two at low signal strengths. Can also be used instead of the "sticky carrier" configuration described below. |
    | **Sticky Carrier** | The serving frequency is given a higher priority than the other frequency. | Above a configurable signal strength threshold UEs remain on the serving frequency. Below the threshold UEs can reselect the other (lower priority) frequency if it is above a second threshold. | IFLB is configured to work in the zone where UEs remain on the serving frequency. | Best used between capacity layers whose coverage is not too different. Allows IFLB to manage load distribution and respects this distribution in idle mode unless the signal strength drops too low. |
    | **Priority Carrier** | One frequency is given a higher priority than the other frequency. | UEs reselect to the higher priority frequency provided its level is above a configurable signal strength threshold. | The idle mode priority push is the primary mechanism for load distribution. | This configuration is best used between frequencies with very different coverage footprints and/or capacities, where it is necessary to actively push UEs to the frequency with the higher capacity and/or poorer coverage. |
